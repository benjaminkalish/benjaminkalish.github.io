                <p>A mock blog site with built with React which utilizes React Router with a loader. Posts and comments
                    are populated from an API via AJAX. Posts of an individual user can be selected and comments shown
                    or hidden.</p>

                <p>This React app gets user location from geolocation, local storage, or user prompt. It then displays
                    information about current weather and sightings of bird species in a ten-mile radius along with an
                    image of the bird species. The user's location and location of the sighting are displayed on an
                    adjacent map. Data is retrieved from Google, National Weather Service, Wikipedia, and GeoNames APIs
                    via AJAX.</p>

                <p>HTML drag-and-drop mechanics are used to create a new twist on the classic children's toy. jQuery is
                    used for DOM manipulation. Webpack with dynamic imports is employed to bundle files and media.</p>

        <p>As a software developer, I know that writing good, efficient code is a challenge. I also know that I'm up to
            the task</p>
        <p>I have completed extensive computer programming coursework through The School of Evolving Technology, in
            Lakewood, NJ, and I gained a strong understanding of the latest in both the client side and server side of
            web design as well as advanced programing skills in multiple languages. I chose this field because I feel
            that my analytical skills and strong background in mathematics would be put to good use here. Immersing
            myself in coding has ignited my passion for this vibrant, ever-changing field. The challenge of finding
            optimized solutions and presenting them as clear, functional code is what drives me. </p>
        <p>I consider myself a creative thinker. I am growth-focused, ambitious, and eager to expand my skill set and
            put my abilities and knowlege to work. I know that I will be an asset to any team I join. </p>
