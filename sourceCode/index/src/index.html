                </div>
                <p>A mock blog site with built with React which utilizes React Router with a loader. Posts and comments
                    are populated from an API via AJAX. Posts of an individual user can be selected and comments shown
                    or hidden.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This React app gets user location from geolocation, local storage, or user prompt. It then displays
                    information about current weather and sightings of bird species in a ten-mile radius along with an
                    image of the bird species. The user's location and location of the sighting are displayed on an
                    adjacent map. Data is retrieved from Google, National Weather Service, Wikipedia, and GeoNames APIs
                    via AJAX.</p>

                <p>HTML drag-and-drop mechanics are used to create a new twist on the classic children's toy. jQuery is
                    used for DOM manipulation. Webpack with dynamic imports is employed to bundle files and media.</p>

        <p>I'm a software developer who loves the whole process of developing software; from planning to testing to
            distribution. I like to make things I can be proud of. I enjoy being challenged and I love to work through
            problems and build solutions.</p>
        <p>I have an analytical mind with a background in math, am a creative thinker, enjoy being part of a team, and
            am determined to succeed in this field.</p>
        <p>When I'm not debugging code or expanding my skillset, I enjoy spending time with my wife and kids. I also try
            to grab chances to hike, row, and sail.</p>
